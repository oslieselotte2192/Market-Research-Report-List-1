<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bacteriophages Therapy Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lytic</li><li>lysogenic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bacteriophage therapy services involve two primary market types: lytic and lysogenic. Lytic phages actively infect and replicate within bacterial cells, leading to their destruction, making them effective for treating bacterial infections. In contrast, lysogenic phages integrate their genetic material into the host's DNA, allowing them to coexist with the bacteria without immediate harm. This can create a reservoir of potential lytic phages. Both strategies offer unique therapeutic benefits, aiming to combat antibiotic-resistant infections and enhance microbial control.</p></p>
