<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Ventilation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical ventilation equipment market is segmented into non-invasive and invasive types. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) involves devices like CPAP and BiPAP that support breathing without needing intubation, providing comfort and reducing complications for patients with respiratory issues. Invasive ventilation, on the other hand, requires endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver air directly into the lungs, often used in critical care settings for patients needing more intensive respiratory support. Each category serves distinct needs based on patient conditions and treatment requirements.</p></p>
