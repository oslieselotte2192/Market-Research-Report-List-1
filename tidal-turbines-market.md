<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tidal Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tidal turbines market is primarily segmented into horizontal axis turbines (HAT) and vertical axis turbines (VAT). HATs, resembling wind turbines, are oriented parallel to water flow and are known for higher efficiency and power generation capacity. In contrast, VATs, which have blades positioned vertically, can capture energy from waves and currents from multiple directions, making them suitable for turbulent environments. Both types play a vital role in harnessing tidal energy, contributing to sustainable energy solutions and reducing carbon footprints.</p></p>
